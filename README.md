# Lexicon-based-Depression-Classifier

## Overview

The Depression Lexicon Builder is a Python project designed to analyze text data and create a lexicon of words associated with depression. It processes a dataset, calculates word frequencies, and determines the likelihood of words being related to depression based on their frequency within specific labels (e.g., 'depressed' and 'not_depressed'). The resulting lexicon can be used for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks related to depression detection and sentiment analysis.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Depression Lexicon Builder, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/depression-lexicon-builder.git
   cd depression-lexicon-builder

Install the required dependencies: 
pip install pandas nltk

## Usage
- Modify the code to use your dataset path and customize the labels ('depressed' and 'not_depressed') according to your specific use case.
- Execute the code to perform the following tasks:
 * Read the dataset from Google Drive or your local machine.
* Preprocess the text data by tokenizing, converting to lowercase, and removing stopwords and punctuation.
* Calculate word frequencies with respect to labels.
* Compute a depression score for each word based on label frequencies.
* Save the depression lexicon as both JSON and CSV files.
- Use the resulting lexicon for NLP tasks, such as depression detection, sentiment analysis, or keyword extraction.
## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- nltk (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Install the required Python packages using pip as mentioned in the "Getting Started" section.

## Data
Ensure you have a dataset that contains text data and labels (e.g., 'depressed' and 'not_depressed'). Modify the code to point to your dataset's location.

## Code Explanation
The code performs the following tasks:

- Mounts Google Drive if running in a Google Colab environment.
- Imports necessary libraries.
- Downloads NLTK resources for text preprocessing.
- Reads the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Preprocesses the text data, tokenizes it, and calculates word frequencies.
- Computes a depression score for each word and creates a depression lexicon.
- Saves the lexicon as JSON and CSV files.
- Optionally, loads the lexicon from JSON and CSV files for verification.
